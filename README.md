When I was fifteen, sixteen
When I started really to play the guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because, it was
The dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance
Because I was living in a little town, was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought "well, now I may have a little bit of a chance"
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music


At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they already had discotheques
So I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home
And that helped me for about almost two years to survive
In the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the fifties
The sounds of the sixties, of the seventies
And then have a sound of the future
And I thought: "Wait a second
I know the synthesizer, why don't I use the synthesizer
Which is the sound of the future"
And I didn't have any idea what to do but I knew I needed a click
So we put a click on the 24-track which was then synced to the Moog modular
I knew that it could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much impact would be


My name is Giovanni Giorgio, but everybody calls me Giorgio
